Arduino is a common electronics platform which is taken as an example here. The illustration shown below is the Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4. A quick summary on the microcontroller is that it features 20 digital input/output pins, out of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs. It incorporates a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button, encompassing all necessary components to facilitate the microcontroller's operations. To initiate, one can seamlessly connect it to a computer using a USB cable or power it through an AC-to-DC adapter or battery.

The below picture describes about the processor (high level view is circled in yellow in the aboove picture) and it's connectivity.

The below picture is referred to as a package. The pin placements of this package are entirely determined by the Arduino board under development. The connectivity between the chip and the package is illustrated through wires, enabling the transmission of signals in and out of the chip.

- Pads: These are structures designed to facilitate the connection between the integrated circuit (IC) and the outside world. These pads serve as interfaces for electrical signals to enter or exit the IC package. They are strategically placed around the perimeter of the IC to align with the package's pins or solder balls, allowing for efficient electrical connection during assembly and usage.
- Core: It is a segmented unit of logic designed to carry out all processor functions, housing all essential digital logic building blocks within it.
- Die: It is a single, individual semiconductor chip that is fabricated on a silicon wafer. After fabrication on the silicon wafer, the wafer is diced into individual dies, each representing a separate unit that can be packaged and used as a discrete electronic component in various electronic devices.
- Macros: These refer to a pre-designed and pre-verified block of logic that performs a specific function and can be reused across multiple chip designs. Macros are typically larger and more complex than standard cells. Macros can include a wide range of functionalities, such as arithmetic units, memory blocks, communication interfaces, analog blocks, and specialized processors. They are designed to be easily integrated into larger chip designs and provide designers with ready-made solutions for common or complex functions.
- Foundary IP's: It refers to pre-designed and pre-verified blocks of reusable digital or analog circuitry provided by semiconductor foundries to their customers for integration into custom integrated circuits (ICs) or System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. These IP blocks can include various components such as standard cell libraries, memory blocks, input/output (I/O) cells, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), interface controllers, and specialized processors.

While foundry IP is a broader concept encompassing various types of reusable circuit blocks provided by semiconductor foundries, macros specifically refer to pre-designed functional blocks intended for reuse within chip designs. Macros are a subset of foundry IP and are typically larger, more complex, and designed to perform specific functions within a chip.
